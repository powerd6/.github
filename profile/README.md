# powerd6

A remixable TTRPG built for sharing.

## What is this?

The powerd6 project aims to create an ecosystem of modules and tools that allows
others to create, play, and mix rules and content together in an unified way.

Our main goals are:

- Be easy to learn
- Be infinitely extensible
- Allow the community to make things

## How to contribute?

At the moment, the project is on its early days, and external contributions are
not likely to be accepted.

You can still submit PRs and create issues on the repositories that exist, but be
mindful that your changes might not align with the future plans of the project and
could be rejected.

You can also submit ideas for modules that you'd like to see on [this page](https://github.com/orgs/powerd6/projects/1),
and they might get picked up for implementation soon.
